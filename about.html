            <h1>My Story</h1><br>
            <p>
                I am pursuing a B.tech in computer science engineering graduating in June 2024.
                Also, I did an internship as a Technical content writer at GeeksForGeeks in which I published 16
                articles on technical
                topics. Before taking admission in a college, I was very interested in technology and computer. This all
                starts with the
                projects which I made a long back in 10th class. So, I decided to take Science in 10+2 to achieve my
                goals. My goal is
                to become a successful software engineer in a big MNC with a big annual package in my bank account.
                During graduation, my interest starts growing in the coding field so
                firstly I start C language and then move on to JAVA programming. Now I love to do coding in JAVA and
                slowly I start developing android
                applications(some of them are shown under the major projects category).<br>
                As I was an average student, my aggregate CGPA is 7 and 85% in my 12th. I am very keen to make new
                friends and explore
                different societies. So please don't hesitate to reach out.
